2.Program find the frequncy of each number
3.How to sort key in hashmap 
4.Why spring boot preffer over spring
5.What is hashing 
6.Concurrent Hashmap
7.Different concurrent hashmap between hashmap 
8.What is function interface 
9.Java 7 (callable . runable, comparetor, compareable) and java 8 function interface (function , supplier, predicate, consumer) 
10.Improment in hashmap in java 8 (while hashing collision happen we store the value in link list one threasold after that we use it red black binary tree);
11.What is the stream and why we are using it ?(stre is concise way of iterating over collections, we can chain the no of opration in stream like intermediate, and termination opration);
12.Static and defult method different (do't want override and having same functionalty using defult method)
13.What is aggregation and composition most confusing interview quetion
14.Diff ArrayList and Linklist

4.what is the springbootAppliction annotation (combination of @EnableAutoconfiguration, @configuration, @componatscan)   
5.What is JPA
6.whay using spring framework (benifit IOC, DI)(IOC is third party library in spring using for creating, managing and destroy bean)
7.how many type ioc container present in spring (two type ApplicationContext and BeanFactory, application context extend the beanfactory class)
8.which container is egar and lazy loading 
9.Java 8 key feature(Lambada expresion, stream api, DateTime api, optional class)
10.what is stream (Stram is way to perform a pipeline of opration over collection in java in a concise manner. we have two type of opration intermediate and terminal)
11. intermediate opration and terminal opration (intermediate opration are those opration which return the stream like filter and map, and terminal opration are those oprations which  written to collect the output)
12. use stream and dataTime api
